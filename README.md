# Thousands of UK motorists can drive with over 12 points

In August 2017 we [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40862975) that more than 10,000 motorists are allowed on the roads despite having 12 or more penalty points on their licence.

## Get the data

We took public data on driving licences, and pivoted that in different ways. One avenue of analysis was to try to match postcodes to local authority areas. It was possible to do this but we decided not to use this analysis as it was not an exact classification (the proportion of postcodes in each LA would be a proxy for the proportion of drivers from that postcode in the LA, but not the same), and because it was an administrative measurement not used by the DVLA.
